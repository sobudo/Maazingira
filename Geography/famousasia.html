                <p> Indian rhinoceros (great one-horned rhinoceros) is the second largest member (white rhino is the largest) of a rhino family. It can be found in India and Nepal. They live in floodplain grasslands, swamps and forests. They are htreatened
                  by habitat loss due to agricultural development and poaching. Indian rhinoceros has brownish-grey skin with folds that create appearance of an armor. Shoulders and legs are covered with wart-like bumps. Indian rhinoceros has heavy skull,
                  prehensile upper lip, flexible ears, bulky body and short tail. Indian rhinoceros has only one horn that can reach 9.8 to 22.5 inches in length. Horn is made of keratin, just like human hair and nails. Indian rhinoceros has poor eyesight,
                  but excellent sense of hearing and smell.Despite its bulky body, Indian rhinoceros is very fast animal (maximum speed 34 miles per hour) that can quickly change direction of movement. Indian rhinoceros is grazer. Its diet is mostly based
                  on the grass. Indian rhinoceros is very good swimmer..</p>

                <p> The Indian cobra is venomous and is one of the most dangerous snakes in India. ...the Indian cobra is attracted to places like rice paddies. ...cobras are deaf, and their 'dance' is a reaction to the movements of a fakir's flute, rather
                  than the music? ..The Indian Cobra, also known as the Asian Cobra, is a very poisonous snake. It has been popular with snake charmers for centuries. These snakes cannot hear. When they are disturbed, they rear up and spread their ribs
                  to form a hood, making their head appear larger. When they attack, they make a quick stab and hold their prey until the poison takes effect. The female lays 20 to 30 eggs at a time ...Indian cobras are considered holy animals and certain

                <h3>Snow Leopard</h3>
                <p> Snow leopards live in colder parts of the world around the mountains of central Asia, in countries such as Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan. Snow leopards are camouflaged in their mountain habitat and are
                  rarely seen in the wild. Unlike other big cats, snow leopards are unable to roar. Snow leopards are physically the smallest members of the group of animals known as the ‘big cats’. (This group also includes lions, tigers, leopards and
                  jaguars.) Snow leopards’ tails are longer, in proportion to body size, than those of most other cats. This may help to provide them with better balance for walking in rocky environments. Snow leopards have smoky-grey coloured fur, which
                  provides camouflage in rocky, snow-covered habitat. The snow leopard’s spots – known as rosettes – help it to blend in with the rocks on the slopes of the mountains. Whereas most big cats have yellow eyes, snow leopards have light green
                  or grey eyes. This helps them to blend into their environment. Snow leopards have thick fur. Their tails, which are not only long, but also thick, are used to protect their faces from the cold when the animal is resting. Snow leopards
                  have wide paws, which allow them to walk on snow without sinking into it. </p>

                <h2>Bactrian Camel</h2>
                <p>The Bactrian camel has two humps used for storing fat. They use the fat by turning it into energy so they can go for a long time without food or water. When the humps on a Bactrian camel are full of fat they stand upright. When their fat
                  reserves are low then the humps become droopy. They have a thick fur coat to keep them warm in the winter. Bactrian camels are actually critically endangered. The biggest threat to them is humans destroying their natural habitat for
                  farming and mining. They are mainly found in Mongolia and China. Bactrian camels have only one natural predator - the grey wolf. They are the only land mammals capable of drinking salt water without any ill effects. They have sealable
                  nostrils, to stop the sand getting up their nose.</p>
