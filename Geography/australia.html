                <h2>Koalas</h2>
                <p>Where they live: Australia<br> Food: Eucalyptus leaves<br> Type: Marsupials<br> Koalas are not bears. A group of mammals, most marsupials have pouches where their newborns develop. The closest living relative of the koala is the wombat.
                  Koalas have sharp claws which help them climb trees. Koalas have similar fingerprints to humans. Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia. Koalas get almost all their moisture from the leaves they eat, and rarely
                  drink water. Eucalyptus leaves are super tough and poisonous! Luckily for koalas, their digestive system allows them to break down the leaves unharmed. When not feasting on leaves, they spend their time dozing in the branches and can
                  sleep for up to 18 hours a day!

                  <h2>Dingoes</h2>
                  <p>Where they live: Australia<br>Food: rabbits, lizards, sheep, kangaroos <br>Type: <br> The dingo is a wild dog with strong jaws and sharp teeth.<br> They cannot bark, but they can howl<br> They are able to rotate their wrists and can
                    use its paw like a hand and even to turn door handles.<br>They can turn their heads 180 degrees in each direction<br> Their ears always stick up.<br> They live in grasslands, rainforest, desert, mountains, and woodlands, but mostly
                    in the Outback.<br> Dingoes are usually golden or reddish, but sometimes brown or black.<br> They live together in packs of up to twelve dogs.<br> Dingoes are terrific hunters, for smaller animals, dingoes hunt alone, usually at night,
                    but for larger prey, like kangaroos they will hunt in packs. <br>Australian farmers do not like dingoes because they prey on their sheep. Desperate to keep their animals safe, South East Australia built what is generally considered
                    the longest fence in the world to keep them out.</p>

                  <p> Where they live: Australia<br>Food: Grass and Roots<br>Type: Mammals/Marsupials<br> Wombats look somewhat like a little bear. There are two basic kinds of wombats, the Bare-nosed wombat, and the Hairy-nosed wombat. Wombats are nocturnal
                    grazers. They live in large burrows up to 30 meters long. Wombats are extremely strong and very proficient diggers. Wombats are generally solitary. Most Australians have never seen a wild wombat</p>

                  <h2>Tasmanian Devil</h2>
                  <p>Tasmanian Devils only live in Tasmania an island state of Australia. Tasmanian Devils are mostly black usually have white hair on their chest or back. They are an endangered species. They are nocturnal meaning they sleep during the day
                    and are up at night. Tasmanian Devil’s are carnivores- meaning they eat meat. They are scavengers, they perfer to eat animals that are already dead. Tasmanian Devils are marsupials (the females have a pouch) When Tasmanian Devils feel
                    like they are in danger they will let out a shrieking sound and show their teeth. Tasmanian Devils like to spend their time alone. A mother gives birth to 20-40 devil’s per pregnancy, they are the size of a grain of rice when they
                    are born. A mother can fit 4 baby devil’s in her pouch. When they are born they race to the pouch the first 4 that make it survive. Tasmanian devils are good because they eat dead animals and mice. They’re like the garbage men of Tasmania.
                    They keep the land clean. They have sharp teeth. They can eat almost every part of a dead animal, including the skin and bones. Tasmanian devils are nocturnal. They have a stinky smell when they’re scared.</p>
