          <p>The wild boar is in the same family as the domestic pig. It has a pig-like snout, and its canines are visible even when the mouth is closed. An adult wild boar has a thick, coarse hair coat that’s black to brownish-red to white. Wild boars are
            nocturnal, and live in groups of 6 to 20 called "sounders". A wild boar can live in any climate except in extremely cold or extremely hot habitats. </p>

            <p>Reindeers and Santa Claus go hand in hand. Instead of horns, male and female reindeers have branch-like antlers on their heads. These food sources are found in boreal forests, the Arctic tundra habitats, and mountain ranges. Reindeers live
              in herds ranging in size from tens to hundreds, whether as residents or migrating. In a single day, they can walk 19 to 55 kilometers, and can run at speeds of 60 to 80 kilometers per hour.</p>

              <div>
                <p> The Arctic fox lives in snow burrows in temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees centigrade in the treeless tundra of the Arctic regions. This extends into Eurasia, North America, the Canadian archipelago, the Siberian islands, Alaska,
                  Greenland, Iceland. The Arctic fox has thick fur that in winter changes to white or blue-gray to blend in with the snow, and after winter changes back to brown or gray to blend in with the tundra’s rocks and plants. The fur enables it
                  to maintain steady body temperature as well, and its thick paws allow it to walk on snow and ice. The Arctic fox has strong hearing thanks to its wide, frontward-facing ears which enable it to locate prey even beneath the snow. On hearing
                  the prey’s location, it leaps into the air and breaks through the snow layers and grabs the prey hiding beneath.</p>

              </div>
              <p>There are more Moose in Sweden than any other country in the World. Moose is the largest of all the deer species. Did you know that nearly 100,000 moose are shot each year during the hunting season? There are 400,000 moose in Sweden before
                the hunting season, 100,000 are hunted. 100,000 calves are born each Spring. Dark brown body with long greyish white legs. Males are distinct with antlers. Antlers are shed each Winter and grow out again during the Summer season. It has
                a short and stubby hairy tail, long nose and long ears. These hooves also act as snowshoes to support the heavy animals in soft snow and in muddy or marshy ground. Moose are solitary and do not live in families or herds. The calves follow
                the cow during one year. Although hundreds of thousands of Moose inhabit Sweden it can still be difficult to see a Moose in the wild. The cow gives birth to one or two calves, sometimes even three. More fun facts about Moose Moose are
                good swimmers! Once a Moose swam from Sweden to Denmark. Unfortunately, after about a week it was hit by a train and died. Moose can run faster than you! They can run up to 60 kilometers an hour and trot steadily at 30 kilometers an hour.

                  than the music? ..The Indian Cobra, also known as the Asian Cobra, is a very poisonous snake. It has been popular with snake charmers for centuries. These snakes cannot hear. When they are disturbed, they rear up and spread their ribs
                  to form a hood, making their head appear larger. When they attack, they make a quick stab and hold their prey until the poison takes effect. The female lays 20 to 30 eggs at a time ...Indian cobras are considered holy animals and certain

                <h3>Snow Leopard</h3>
                <p> Snow leopards live in colder parts of the world around the mountains of central Asia, in countries such as Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan. Snow leopards are camouflaged in their mountain habitat and are
                  rarely seen in the wild. Unlike other big cats, snow leopards are unable to roar. Snow leopards are physically the smallest members of the group of animals known as the ‘big cats’. (This group also includes lions, tigers, leopards and
                  jaguars.) Snow leopards’ tails are longer, in proportion to body size, than those of most other cats. This may help to provide them with better balance for walking in rocky environments. Snow leopards have smoky-grey coloured fur, which
                  provides camouflage in rocky, snow-covered habitat. The snow leopard’s spots – known as rosettes – help it to blend in with the rocks on the slopes of the mountains. Whereas most big cats have yellow eyes, snow leopards have light green
                  or grey eyes. This helps them to blend into their environment. Snow leopards have thick fur. Their tails, which are not only long, but also thick, are used to protect their faces from the cold when the animal is resting. Snow leopards
                  have wide paws, which allow them to walk on snow without sinking into it. </p>

                <h2>Bactrian Camel</h2>
                <p>The Bactrian camel has two humps used for storing fat. They use the fat by turning it into energy so they can go for a long time without food or water. When the humps on a Bactrian camel are full of fat they stand upright. When their fat
                  reserves are low then the humps become droopy. They have a thick fur coat to keep them warm in the winter. Bactrian camels are actually critically endangered. The biggest threat to them is humans destroying their natural habitat for
                  farming and mining. They are mainly found in Mongolia and China. Bactrian camels have only one natural predator - the grey wolf. They are the only land mammals capable of drinking salt water without any ill effects. They have sealable
                  nostrils, to stop the sand getting up their nose.</p>
