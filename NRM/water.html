            other uses. <br>That's why it is so important to take care of the water we have.</p2>

                  may even go swimming in it!<br> If you are lucky, water always seems to be there. It comes out of the tap every time you turn it on.<br> The world has lots of water, but it also has lots of living things (including people)that need it.
                  <br>Unfortunately, not everyone has water when they need it.</p>

            <p>Take quick showers instead of baths.<br> Turn off the tap while brushing teeth.<br>Flush the toilet when needed, but don't keep doing it just so you can watch the water spin!<br> Remembering to turn off the tap is a great way to save water!<br>              You can save water by not turning the tap on full-blast every time you use it.<br> You can even recycle some water! If you've had a bath or washed dishes, you can use it on houseplants or the outdooors in the garden.</p>

            <p class="reality"> More than 500 million people around the world have no safe clean water supply. This affects our health.<br> Millions of people die every year dfrom diseases caused from using dirty water. Many of them are children under the age of 5.<br> Little
              or no water prevents many young children, especially girls, from going to school. They are busy helping their mothers fetching water.<br> A lack of clean water means the no toilets or dirty toilets in schools.<br> We can practice water conservation
              by only using what we need and by keeping our water clean.</p>
