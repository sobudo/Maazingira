        <h1>Butterfly life Cycle</h1>
        <img class="header" src="images/header.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 800px;">
        <p class="header">Probably the most beautiful insect people are not afraid of! Lets explore a butterflies life from birth to adult. As they grow, they go through an incredible process called ‘metamorphisis’ To grow into an adult they go through 4 stages: egg, larva,
          pupa and adult. Depending on the type of butterfly, the life cycle of a butterfly may take anywhere from one month to a whole year. You can print out this Butterfly Life Cycle coloring page to follow along as we talk about the 4 stages.</p>

              <h2>Stage 1: The Egg</h2>
              <img src="images/butterflyeggs.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p> The female butterfly lays eggs on leaves of plants. The eggs are very small and can be round, oval <br>or cylindrical and smooth, bumpy or wrinkled depending on the species.<br> With some eggs, if you look close enough you can actually see
                the tiny caterpillar growing inside of it,<br> especially Monarch butterflies! Some eggs hatch within a few days and in others they will only hatch<br>once the weather is warm enough.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 2: The Larva (Caterpillar)</h2>
              <img src="images/butterflylarvae.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p>Out of the egg hatches a caterpillar and in this stage all they do is eat. They love to eat. They actually <br>eat their way out of the egg and begin to eat the leaf they were born onto. <br>This is really important because the mother butterfly
                needs to lay her eggs on the type of leaf the<br> caterpillar will eat – each caterpillar type likes only certain types of leaves.<br> Caterpillars need to eat and eat so they can grow quickly. <br>When a caterpillar is born, they are
                extremely small. A fully grown caterpillar can be over 100 times <br>larger than when it emerged from its egg. When they start eating, they instantly start growing and <br>expanding.<br> Their skin does not stretch or grow, so they grow
                by “molting” (sheding the outgrown skin) several <br>times while it grows. They shed their skin four or five times – the skin becomes too tight and splits<br> open, revealing a new, larger skin underneath.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 3: Pupa (Chrysalis)</h2>
              <img src="images/butterflypupa.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p> The pupa stage is one of the coolest stages of a butterfly’s life. As soon as a caterpillar is done growing<br> and they have reached their full length/weight, they form themselves into a pupa, also known as a <br>chrysalis. From the outside
                of the pupa, it looks as if the caterpillar may just be resting, but the inside<br> is where all of the action is. Inside of the pupa, the caterpillar is rapidly changing. Within the chrysalis<br> the old body parts of the caterpillar
                are undergoing a remarkable transformation, called ‘metamorphosis,’<br> to become the beautiful parts that make up the butterfly that will emerge.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 4: Adult Butterfly</h2>
              <img src="images/butterfly.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p> Finally, when the caterpillar has done all of its forming and changing inside the pupa. When the butterfly<br> first emerges from the chrysalis, both of the wings are going to be soft and folded against its body. This<br>is because the butterfly
                had to fit all its new parts inside of the pupa. As soon as the butterfly has rested<br> after coming out of the chrysalis, it will pump blood into the wings in order to get them working and<br>flapping – then they get to fly. Usually
                within a three or four-hour period, the butterfly will master flying<br> and will search for a mate in order to reproduce. When in the fourth and final stage of their lives, adult<br> butterflies are constantly on the look out to reproduce
                and when a female lays their eggs on some<br> leaves, the butterfly life cycle will start all over. </p>
