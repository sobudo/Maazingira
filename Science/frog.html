        <h1>Frog life Cycle</h1>
        <img class="header" src="images/frogheader.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 800px;">
        <p class="header">Just like butterflies, frogs undergo metamorphosis (a change of shape) during their life cycle. A tadpole will develop back legs first, then front legs. After a few weeks, their mouth starts to widen, then their eyes start to bulge out and the
          tail begins to shrink and eventually disappear. When the lungs finish developing the froglet makes it’s way onto the land and, abracadabra, it’s a frog!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mainbody">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-8" .col-sm-8>
            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 1: Spawn (egg-mass)</h2>
              <img src="images/frogeggs.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p> Frogs lay many many eggs because of many dangers faced between the egg stage and a full grown frog. Frogs lay up to 4,000 eggs at one time! Some frogs leave after this point, but others stick around to watch over the little ones. Usually,
                about 6-21 days after being fertilized, the egg will hatch. Most eggs are found in calm or static waters, to prevent getting too rumbled about in infancy!
              </p>
            </div>


            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 2: Tadpole</h2>
              <img src="images/tadpole.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p>Tadpoles hatch from the eggs and live in the pond. They have poorly developed gills, a mouth, and a tail. It's really fragile at this point. They usually will stick themselves to floating weeds or grasses in the water. Then, 7 to 10 days
                after the tadpole has hatched, it will begin to swim around and feed on algae. After about 4 weeks, the gills start getting grown over by skin, until they eventually disappear. The tadpoles get teeny tiny teeth which help them grate food.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
              <h2>Stage 3: Tadpole with legs</h2>
              <img src="images/frogletback.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p> After about 6 to 9 weeks, little tiny legs start to sprout. The head becomes more distinct and the body elongates. By now the diet may grow to include larger items like dead insects and even plants. The arms will begin to bulge where they
                will eventually pop out, elbow first. After about 9 weeks, the tadpole looks more like a teeny frog with a really long tail. It is now well on it's way to being almost fullgrown!

              <img src="images/froglet.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
              <p>The tadpoles turn into Froglets. The body shrinks and legs form. By 12 weeks, the tadpole has only a teeny tail stub and looks like a miniature version of the adult frog. Soon, it will leave the water, only to return again to laymore eggs
                and start the process all over again!</p>

            <h2>Stage 4: Frog</h2>
            <img src="images/frog.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
            <p> The Froglet's tail shrinks, the lungs develop and the back legs grow and then we have a Frog. By between 12 to 16 weeks, depending on water and food supply, the frog has completed the full growth cycle. Now these frogs will start the whole
              process again...finding mates and creating new froggies. Some frogs that live in higher altitudes or in colder places might take a whole winter to go through the tadpole stage.</p>
